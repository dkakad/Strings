# Strings
This repository consists of my implementation of a few functions which test and manipulate strings.
This exercise really helped cement my understanding about the intricacies of using iterators as well as the differences between the STL 
stringclass and a normal character array.

I am using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 as my IDE.
